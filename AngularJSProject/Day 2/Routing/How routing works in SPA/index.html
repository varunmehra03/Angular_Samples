        An exploration of the future of web technologies and browser capabilities would not
        be complete without covering the tools and techniques available to enable location
        awareness.

    <p>
        Location-aware web applications provide content, functionality, and services based
        on the cooperative detection of the user’s physical location. These applications can
        then provide the user with real-time filtering of online information relevant to his current
        location, such as place markers indicating the user’s location within a map, local
        consumer reviews, local coupons and offers, and even relevant traffic and public
        transportation notices.

        As you might imagine, the opportunities are not just limited to enhancing the life of
        the consumer. Given real-time location data of potential consumers and their friends,
        retailers can also create highly targeted, location-specific marketing campaigns for
        both digital and physical products
